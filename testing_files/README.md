## üöÄ Pipeline Generation Testing

### Files for Pipeline Generation (`/api/pipeline/generate`):

6. **`pipeline_generation_request.json`** - Enterprise React/Next.js project
   - **What it tests**: Custom pipeline generation based on tech stack
   - **Tech stack**: React, TypeScript, Next.js, PostgreSQL, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform
   - **Requirements**: High compliance (SOC 2, GDPR), high performance, large team
   - **Expected output**: Multi-stage enterprise pipeline with security, testing, and deployment

## üß™ How to Test Each Service

### 1. Using the Web UI (Easiest)
1. Start frontend: `cd SWISSARMORY_V1.0/frontend && npm run dev`
2. Open `http://localhost:5173`
3. Upload the appropriate files to each section:
   - **Code Review**: Upload `.diff` files
   - **Pipeline Tuner**: Upload `.yml` files
   - **Test Genie**: Upload `.json` files

### 2. Using API Documentation
1. Visit `http://localhost:8000/docs`
2. Use the interactive Swagger UI to upload files
3. See real-time responses and analysis

### 3. Using cURL (Advanced)

**Code Review:**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/review" \
  -F "file=@testing_files/code_review_test.diff"
```

**Pipeline Optimization:**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/pipeline" \
  -F "file=@testing_files/pipeline_optimization_test.yml"
```

**Test Generation:**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/tests" \
  -F "file=@testing_files/test_coverage_report.json"
```

**Pipeline Generation:**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/pipeline/generate" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @testing_files/pipeline_generation_request.json
```

## üéØ What to Expect

### Enhanced Analysis Features:
- **Detailed diff parsing** with statistics
- **AI-powered insights** and recommendations
- **Security vulnerability detection**
- **Performance optimization suggestions**
- **Multi-platform pipeline templates**
- **Comprehensive metrics and scoring**

### Mock vs Real AI:
- **Without API keys**: Intelligent mock responses with realistic analysis
- **With API keys**: Full AI-powered analysis using OpenAI/Anthropic models
